## Assembly and ISA-level code

Assembly code is very close to the actual ISA-level code that computers execute.

The ISA level is the interface between the software and the hardware.

## IA32 (Intel Architecture, 32-bit)

IA-32 (Intel Architecture, 32-bit) is the 32-bit version of the x86 instruction set architecture, developed by Intel and first implemented in the 80386 microprocessor.

### Registers

IA32 CPUs contain eight 32-bit registers.

The six registers eax-edi can be considered general-purpose.

The two registers esp-ebp contain pointers to
important places in the stack.

All eight registers can be accessed as either
16 bits (word) or 32 bits (double word).

**When a byte instruction updates a single-byte register, the remaining three bytes of the full register remain unchanged.**

### Data types

### Operands

### Stack

The IA32 programming model also provides a **stack**, where temporary data can be stored.

This stack is stored in some region of the main memory.

It is accessed through the instructions pushl and popl.

The stack pointer esp holds the memory address of the top stack element.

## Instructions

### Data movement instructions

The term “move” is as a synonym of “copy,” since the values in the source remain there unchanged.

### Arithmetic instructions

### Logical instructions

### Test instructions

### SET instructions

### JUMP instructions

![Untitled](IA32%2099955f18ead54733923733b9d3f4c515/Untitled%2014.png)

With these instructions combined, we can create **program control**, giving the possibility to move through instructions given certain states of the program.

As we can see in this example bellow:

![Untitled](IA32%2099955f18ead54733923733b9d3f4c515/Untitled%2015.png)

The $\text{.lbX:}$ is a **label** where $\text X$ represents the number of the label. It helps to identify where a jump goes to, in the program code.

**Jump types:**

- In an absolute jump, the instruction directly indicates the location in the memory to where the program jumps.
- In a relative jump, the value indicated in the instruction is a signed offset that is added to the address of the instruction following the jump instruction to calculate the destination.

## Procedures

A procedure is a mechanism used to encapsulate and reuse code.

Assume that procA calls procB.
This call implies the following steps:

- **Control**: IP must be set to the starting address of the code for procB upon entry; when procB ends, the IP must be set to the instruction in procA that follows the call to procB.
- **Arguments and return value**: procA must be able to provide the arguments to procB, which must be able to return a value back to procA.
- **Local memory**: procB may need to allocate space for local variables when it starts executing and then free it before returning back to procA.

The structure created in the stack to support the execution of each procedure call is called stack frame.

It includes space for:

- the arguments
- the return information
- the registers
- the local variables

Some parts may be omitted if not needed, to optimise the program.

## Arrays

`datatype arr[N];`

This declaration allocates a contiguous region of $N\times S$ bytes in memory, where $S$ is the size in bytes of `datatype`.

It also introduces an identifier `arr` that can be used as a pointer to the beginning of the array.

Array element i is stored at address $b_{arr}+i\times S$.

## Structs

With respect to a struct declaration, its implementation is similar to that of arrays:

- all its components are stored in a contiguous area of the memory
- the base pointer to that structure is the address of its first byte

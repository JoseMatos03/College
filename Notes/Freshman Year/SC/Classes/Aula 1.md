## Introduction

A **computer** is a programmable device that can execute a sequence of instructions. The sequence of instructions that perform a specific task is a **program**.

It’s considered a computer the device that follows both of the following characteristics:

- **Data-dependent instruction sequence:** Conditional branch constructors (`IF-THEN-ELSE`, `SWITCH`, `DO-WHILE`, etc.) that depend on values that are calculated during run-time.
- **Data-dependent data selection:** Uses data to determine other data used in calculations.

## Computer levels

- A computer can execute a set of simple operations *(toggle list)*. These instructions form what’s called a **machine language**, that operate the computer. Although this language exists mainly to be executed by the computer and not to be understood by humans. This can be built upon, so computer systems can be designed in an organised, structured and layered way.
    - Add two numbers;
    - Test for equality;
    - Read and write data;
    - Perform logical conditions.
